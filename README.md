# TCC_Hunt-For-The-Wyvern-Queen

This project was made as a fan game based on the Monster Hunter franchise by Capcom, with the sole purpose of learning how to develop a game in Unreal Engine 5 and the implementation of 3D characters inside the engine. 

The intention behind this project was also to provide a way to newcomers and students to learn the software by providing something that is 100% working, so...

..all project files, including both characters rigs, are available here, for free.

To access only the final game on itch.io, here is the link: https://hullerart.itch.io/hunt-for-the-wyvern-queen
