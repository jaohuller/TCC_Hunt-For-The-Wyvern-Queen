# Hunt For The Wyvern Queen Game Release!

![Final Trailer com QR Code](https://github.com/jaohuller/TCC_Hunt-For-The-Wyvern-Queen/assets/45441340/b21b31e4-b3ec-43a2-9779-606ae6d6e706)

This project was made as a fan game based on the Monster Hunter franchise by Capcom, being part of a college thesis where I study how to develop a game in Unreal Engine 5 and the implementation of 3D characters and their animations inside the engine. 

The intention behind this project was also to provide a way to newcomers and students to learn the software by providing something that is 100% working, so... all project files, including both characters rigs, are available here for free.

**You can do whatever you want with the files, as long as you give me the deserved credits at the end of your project** :D
