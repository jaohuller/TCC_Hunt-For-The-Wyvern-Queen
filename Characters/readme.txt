Both characters were made using two rigs, a technique to ensure that all animations work within the game engine.
To automate the process of baking animations from one rig to the other, the Game Rig Tools addon was used.
Here is a youtube video explaining how it works and how to download it: https://youtu.be/iZBx1I7vmQ0?si=jB5zLBxU95_14Ht1

Also, the addon Action Manager was used to organize all the animations in a easier way. 

Have fun animating :D
